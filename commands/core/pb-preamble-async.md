# Preamble Part 2: Async & Distributed Teams

## Overview

The core preamble assumes synchronous, real-time conversation. This part extends preamble thinking to:
- Asynchronous communication (Slack, GitHub, email, async meetings)
- Distributed and remote teams
- Time zones and async-first cultures
- Written feedback and code review comments

**Status:** In development — awaiting philosophy expansion details

### 4. Timing and Intent in Async
- When to challenge immediately vs. wait
- Escalation patterns in async
- How long to debate before deciding
- Async decision-making protocols
