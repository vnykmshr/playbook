# v2.12.0 Quick Start Guide

**Start here.** This guide explains v2.12.0 in three depth levels. Read what you need; skip the rest.

## 🚀 Level 1: The 5-Minute Read

**What is v2.12.0?**

v2.12.0 adds three capabilities that solve a real problem: context is expensive, and your development guidelines shouldn't disappear when you switch tasks or end a session.

**The three phases:**
1. **BEACON System** — Your most important guidelines (9 critical ones) are marked and verified at every session boundary so they never silently vanish
2. **Enhanced Pause/Resume** — When you stop work, your context gets preserved and verified; when you resume, guidelines are checked before you continue
3. **Git Signals** — Your codebase tells you what's working and what needs attention, enabling smart quarterly planning

**Why this matters:** Efficient sessions + safe context switches + data-driven decisions = sustainable excellence.

**How to start:**
- Read "Level 2: Understanding the Phases" below (takes ~20-30 min)
- Or jump to "Level 3: Detailed Documentation" for full information
- Or skip to "Real-World Workflow" if you prefer learning by example

## 🎯 Level 2: Understanding the Phases

### Phase 1: BEACON System (Context Minimization)

**What it does:** Marks 9 critical guidelines (6 global + 3 project-specific) that you don't want to lose. At every session boundary (pause, resume, context switch), the system verifies these guidelines are still in place.

**Example BEACONs:**
- Global: "Challenge assumptions" (peer collaboration mindset)
- Global: "No hardcoded secrets" (security)
- Project: "All commands need metadata" (governance)

**Why it matters:** Prevents silent guideline loss. You've forgotten important principles before at context boundaries—now the system catches that.

**When to use:** Always active. No configuration needed; happens automatically.

**Next step:** See `/pb-preamble` for the thinking philosophy that makes this work.

---

### Phase 2: Enhanced Pause/Resume (Session Boundary Protection)

**What it does:** When you use `/pb-pause`, the system saves your current work state AND verifies BEACONs before stopping. When you use `/pb-resume`, it loads your context back AND re-verifies BEACONs before continuing.

**Example workflow:**
```
Friday 5 PM (end of day)
  → /pb-pause (saves work, verifies BEACONs, notes for Monday)
  → Safe to close everything

Monday 9 AM (resuming)
  → /pb-resume (loads context, re-verifies BEACONs, confirms guidelines)
  → Ready to continue safely
```

**Why it matters:** Context switches are risky. You might forget an important constraint or principle. This system verifies constraints at every boundary.

**When to use:** Use `/pb-pause` before long breaks. Use `/pb-resume` to get back into context. The BEACON verification happens automatically.

**Next step:** See `/pb-pause` and `/pb-resume` commands for detailed guidance.

---

### Phase 3: Git Signals (Data-Driven Planning)

**What it does:** Analyzes your git history to answer three questions:
- What's actually being used? (adoption metrics)
- What's changing a lot? (volatility / churn)
- What's causing problems? (pain points detected through error rates, reverts)

**Example signals:**
- "Auth module: stable (low churn), zero pain score → working well"
- "Payment module: high churn (5+ refactors), pain score 7 → needs attention"
- "Logging: adopted by 40% of code → moderate uptake"

**Why it matters:** Quarterly planning should be data-driven. Instead of guessing what to work on next, you have evidence of what's working and what's broken.

**When to use:** Run `/pb-git-signals` before quarterly planning (`/pb-evolve`). Use the signals to prioritize what to work on next.

**Next step:** See `/pb-git-signals` command and `/pb-evolve` for quarterly planning workflow.

## 🔄 Real-World Workflow

**Scenario:** You're finishing a feature Friday afternoon and planning Q2 work for next sprint.

```
FRIDAY 5 PM: End of work on feature
  → Run /pb-pause
     • Saves current work (commits in progress)
     • Verifies 9 BEACONs are still in place
     • Creates pause-notes for Monday
  → Close the laptop, relax

MONDAY 9 AM: Back to work
  → Run /pb-resume
     • Loads your context (working-context.md)
     • Re-verifies 9 BEACONs (confirms key guidelines)
     • Suggests next steps from pause-notes
  → Continue with feature development

WEEKLY (e.g., Thursday):
  → Run /pb-git-signals
     • Analyzes commits since last check
     • Shows adoption trends
     • Highlights pain points
     • Creates signals.json for analysis

END OF QUARTER (Feb, May, Aug, Nov):
  → Run /pb-evolve
     • Reviews quarterly signals
     • Assesses Claude capability updates
     • Proposes playbook improvements
     • Executes evolution cycle
  → Next quarter's playbooks are current with Claude capabilities
```

## 🤔 Decision Tree: Which Phase Do I Need?

**"I want efficient sessions and safe context switches"**
→ Use **Phase 1 (BEACON) + Phase 2 (Pause/Resume)**
- Run `/pb-pause` before breaks
- Run `/pb-resume` when resuming
- BEACONs verify automatically

**"I want to know what to work on next"**
→ Use **Phase 3 (Git Signals)**
- Run `/pb-git-signals` weekly or before planning
- Review pain scores and adoption metrics
- Use signals to prioritize in `/pb-evolve`

**"I want all three (recommended)"**
→ Just keep working normally
- `/pb-pause` at end of day/week
- `/pb-resume` when resuming
- `/pb-git-signals` before quarterly planning
- Playbooks improve every quarter via `/pb-evolve`

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I have to use all three phases?**
A: No. But Phase 1 (BEACON) is automatic—you get it for free. Phase 2 (Pause/Resume) is opt-in but recommended for long breaks. Phase 3 (Git Signals) is best before quarterly planning.

**Q: What if I don't like the BEACONs?**
A: BEACONs are critical guidelines (no hardcoded secrets, challenge assumptions, etc.). They exist to prevent mistakes. See `/pb-preamble` and `/pb-design-rules` for the full philosophy.

**Q: How much overhead does this add?**
A: Minimal. `/pb-pause` takes 5 minutes. `/pb-resume` takes 5 minutes. `/pb-git-signals` takes 10 minutes. Total: ~20 minutes per week for maximum benefit.

**Q: What if BEACON verification fails?**
A: It means a critical guideline was lost. `/pb-resume` will show you which one. Review it, update your context, and continue. This is a feature—you caught something important.

**Q: When does Phase 3 help most?**
A: Before quarterly evolution cycles (`/pb-evolve`). Use signals to answer "What should we work on next?" with data, not guesses.
