# Start Development Work

Begin iterative development on a feature, enhancement, or fix. This command establishes the rhythm for quality-focused, incremental work.

**Mindset:** Development assumes both `/pb-preamble` thinking (challenge assumptions, peer collaboration) and `/pb-design-rules` thinking. Each iteration verifies that code embodies Clarity, Simplicity, and Robustness.

**Resource Hint:** sonnet — routine development workflow orchestration
