## Overview

The Engineering Playbook is a **decision framework** that codifies how to approach development work—from planning through production operations. It's not a tool; it's a set of structured, well-documented processes that work together to reduce friction, prevent common mistakes, and maintain quality at every step.

**Who it's for:**
- Teams adopting structured SDLC workflows
- Projects using Claude Code for development
- Organizations wanting repeatable, documented practices
- New team members learning your development culture

**Key capabilities:**
- **Iterative development workflows** — Clear, repeatable patterns from idea to production
- **Quality gates at every step** — Automatic checks before code moves forward
- **Multi-perspective code reviews** — Code, security, product, tests, performance
- **Pattern library** — 39 documented architectural patterns (async, database, distributed systems)
- **Team operations** — Onboarding, knowledge transfer, incident response, retrospectives
- **Repository organization** — Professional structure and documentation

---

## Quick Start: Five Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Starting a New Project

You've decided to build something new. Here's how to establish a strong foundation:

```bash
# Step 1: Plan the project
/pb-plan              # Define scope, success criteria, phases

# Step 2: Set up repository
/pb-repo-init         # Initialize directory structure
/pb-repo-organize     # Clean folder layout
/pb-repo-readme       # Write compelling README

# Step 3: Document architecture
/pb-adr               # Record architectural decisions
/pb-patterns          # Reference relevant patterns

# Step 4: Begin development
/pb-start             # Create feature branch
/pb-cycle             # (Repeat) Self-review → Peer review → Commit
/pb-pr                # Create pull request

# Step 5: Release
/pb-release           # Pre-release checklist
/pb-deployment        # Choose deployment strategy
```

**See**: `/docs/integration-guide.md` for complete workflow with step-by-step guidance

---

### Scenario 2: Adopting Playbook in Existing Project

Your project already has code and processes. Let's integrate the playbook gradually:

```bash
# Step 1: Understand current state
/pb-context           # Document project context and decisions
/pb-review-code       # Audit existing code quality
/pb-review-hygiene    # Identify technical debt

# Step 2: Establish baseline
/pb-standards         # Define working principles for your team
/pb-guide             # Learn the SDLC framework
/pb-templates         # Create commit/PR templates

# Step 3: Begin structured development
/pb-start             # First feature with new workflow
/pb-cycle             # Use quality gates for code review
/pb-commit            # Structured commits

# Step 4: Scale practices
/pb-team              # Team retrospectives
/pb-knowledge-transfer # Document tribal knowledge
/pb-review-*          # Periodic reviews (monthly, quarterly)

# Step 5: Continuous improvement
/pb-incident          # Handle production issues systematically
/pb-adr               # Document major decisions
/pb-performance       # Optimize when needed
```

**See**: `/docs/integration-guide.md` → "Scenario 2: Adopting Playbook"

---

### Scenario 3: Typical Developer Day

You're in the middle of a feature sprint. Here's your daily rhythm:

```bash
# Morning: Get context
/pb-resume            # Recover context from yesterday
/pb-standup           # Write async standup for team

# Development: Code → Review → Commit (repeat)
/pb-cycle             # Self-review changes
  # Includes: /pb-testing, /pb-security, /pb-standards, /pb-documentation

/pb-commit            # Atomic, well-explained commit

# Before lunch: Big picture
/pb-context           # Refresh project context (decisions, roadmap)
/pb-patterns          # Reference patterns for next component

# Afternoon: Ready to merge?
/pb-cycle             # Final self-review
/pb-pr                # Create pull request with context

# End of day: Status
/pb-standup           # Update team on progress, blockers
```

**See**: `/docs/integration-guide.md` → "Workflow 1: Feature Development"

---

### Scenario 4: Code Review

A PR is ready for review. As a reviewer, you can follow a structured approach:

```bash
/pb-review-code       # Code quality checklist
/pb-security          # Security perspective
/pb-review-tests      # Test coverage and quality
/pb-logging           # Logging standards verification
/pb-review-product    # Product alignment (if user-facing)
```

Each command provides a different lens on the same code, catching different categories of issues.

---

### Scenario 5: Incident Response

Production is down. Execute quickly:

```bash
/pb-incident          # Assess severity, choose mitigation
  # Options: Rollback (fastest), Hotfix, Feature disable

/pb-observability     # Monitor recovery

# After incident (within 24h)
/pb-incident          # Comprehensive review
/pb-adr               # Document decision to prevent repeat
```

**See**: `/docs/integration-guide.md` → "Workflow 3: Incident Response"

                        └─ /pb-pr (+ reviews)
```

### Command Integration

All commands work together as a **unified system**:

- **Foundation** (`/pb-guide`, `/pb-standards`) — Principles all others implement
- **Hub commands** (`/pb-cycle`, `/pb-plan`) — Central junctions connecting workflows
- **Specialized families** (patterns, reviews, repos) — Grouped for coherence

**See** `/docs/integration-guide.md` for complete integration documentation showing all workflows and command relationships.

## Key Principles

### 1. Quality Gates at Every Step
Never skip the review step. Each iteration includes:
- **Self-review** — You catch your own mistakes first
- **Testing** — Code is tested alongside development
- **Security** — Verified before merging
- **Logging** — Standards checked before production
- **Peer review** — Different perspectives catch different issues

### 2. Logical, Atomic Commits
Small commits that:
- Address one concern
- Are always deployable
- Have clear, explanatory messages
- Maintain git history as documentation

### 3. Multi-Perspective Reviews
Code review isn't one perspective:
- **Code reviewer**: Architecture, patterns, maintainability
- **Security engineer**: Input validation, secrets, auth, cryptography
- **Product**: Does it align with user needs?
- **Test engineer**: Coverage, edge cases, regression tests
- **Performance engineer**: Bottlenecks, optimization opportunities

### 4. Documented Decisions
Every architectural decision is recorded (`/pb-adr`), so future team members understand the "why," not just the "what."

### 5. Structured Processes, Not Rigid Rules
The playbook provides frameworks you adapt to your team's needs, not commandments you follow blindly.

---

## Use Cases

### ✅ Perfect for:
- **New teams** — Establish practices from day one
- **Growing teams** — Repeatable processes as you scale
- **Distributed teams** — Async-first practices (standups, KT, reviews)
- **Projects adopting Claude Code** — Workflows designed for AI-assisted development
- **Organizations wanting documented practices** — Knowledge transfer, onboarding, incident response

### ℹ️ Consider alternatives if:
- Your team already has deeply established workflows
- You need language-specific guidance (Go, Python, JavaScript specific commands exist but not all)
- You're looking for IDE plugins or Git integrations
